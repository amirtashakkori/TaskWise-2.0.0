# TaskWise
a project to create your custome TaskManager :
this project allows you to define a list of plans and tasks for yourself in different intervals, so that you can carry out your work with more order and coordination and not fall behind any of your plans!

In this project, we used a complete database to record and store and also retrieve and receive information, which was done using the Room library.
This project can be a good option for those people who have not had a complete project in this field so far and want to gain experience working with a software that uses several different features and need a reference to check the codes.

in this project we used a lot of Android features and attributes such as :
- Room Database library
- Android Work Manager
- Android Notification Manager
- Android Calendar
- Navigation Drawer
- Fragments
- Android Calendar
- RecyclerViews and Adapters
- illustration designs
- Spinners
- Shared Preferences
- Multiple Theme
- Multiple Languages
- Both Light and Dark Mode Support
  and lot more ...


this could be very helpful for those who want to check and compare theire project with a working and active project, I hope it can help you.!
